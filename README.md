# Nelder-Mead-Downhill-Simplex

## Introduction
The Nelder–Mead simplex method [49, 50] is an algorithm for finding the local minima of a function $f:R^n→R$, called the objective function in optimization parlance. The idea
behind it is very geometric. It starts with a suitably chosen initial simplex in $R^n$ and evolves it according to certain rules. The simplex undergoes iterative expansions, contractions, and displacements, and if everything goes according to plan, it moves “downhill” toward a local minimum of f.
